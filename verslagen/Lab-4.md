# Verslag labo 4: Honeypots

## What is a honeypot?

A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable or attractive system, service or resource deployed to detect, study, and distract attackers. It appears as a real target to an adversary but is instrumented to record attacker actions, techniques and indicators of compromise without providing legitimate business value.
